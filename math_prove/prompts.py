Keep key_steps to at most 5 items. Put no long derivation in final_answer.
Use Chinese in reasoning_summary, key_steps, assumptions, target,
derivation_steps, and checkable_claims. The final_answer must be the shortest
judgeable answer, not a narrative paragraph.
Use assumptions/target/derivation_steps/checkable_claims as a compact,
verifier-friendly intermediate form. For easy numeric questions these may be
short; for proof, topology, abstract algebra, or hard questions, fill them with
the actual logical structure of the solution.
Before writing final_answer, check the original problem target, domain,
boundary/initial conditions, parameter ranges, missing cases, extraneous roots,
and answer format. If the answer cannot be reliably determined, use
"unable_to_determine" instead of guessing.
If the problem is a proof or topology-style task, verification_code may be empty.
If you write verification_code, keep it short and make the last relevant output a
single clean line exactly like:
print("FINAL_RESULT_FOR_CHECK:", clean_value)
The clean_value must be the comparable final value only, without Eq(...), debug
text, derivation, or wrappers.

Use confidence from 0 to 1. Mark passed=false if assumptions, theorem conditions,
calculation, special cases, or the ability to judge the answer are doubtful.
Set passed=true only when the final answer directly answers the question, all
conditions/cases are covered, and the result is parseable by an automatic judge.
Cosmetic formatting issues should go in format_check.issues and issues, but do
not make passed=false when question_target_check, condition_check, result_check,
and judgeability_check all pass.
Check the candidate's assumptions, target, derivation_steps, and
checkable_claims explicitly. A failed claim should produce a concrete
repair_instruction; an uncertain claim is a warning unless it blocks judging the
answer.
